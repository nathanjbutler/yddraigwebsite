    <h1>Combat Training</h1>
    <p>The group have weekly training sessions (and post-training pub meetings) in Burslem on Monday evenings. 
        Training starts at 8pm and runs until 10pm. </p>
    <p>Monday evening sessions mostly consist of combat training, although occasionally some members prefer to bring craft projects to work on. 
        Combat training, ranges from beginner's sessions in basic combat safety and up to advanced sessions in shieldwall combat and drills. There is also
        single-combat duelling for our monthly, highly-competitive, combat competition. 
        Combat is a physical activity and requires regular training and practice. 
        Members are expected to maintain a safe standard of training to ensure their safety in combat, but attendance at every training session 
        is not mandatory.</p>
    <p>No equipment is required to be purchased for a beginner, as we can provide it all to start with. However, we would eventually expect members
        to gather some basic kit of their own, including items such as Viking clothing, a starting warrior's weapon and a shield. We will give guidance 
        on how to make, or where to get these items. We fight with safe 'blunt' versions of real weapons, 
        such as metal swords, axes, spears, etc. Our training will teach you to be a safe warrior whilst having a great time in hand-to-hand combat. 
        All of our training conforms to the wider national training schemes of the Vikings society. This ensures that everybody at events is adhering to the 
        same rulebook and same safety standards. Bumps and bruises are to be expected, but anything worse is very rare. </p>
    <p>Please note, members must be 18+ to take part in battles, but can begin their training from age 17.</p>
    <p>Training sessions cost Â£3 per member, payable on the night. This accounts for the hire of the hall. First session is free. </p>
