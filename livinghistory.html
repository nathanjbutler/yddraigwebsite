    <h1>Living History</h1>
    <p>As well as fighting in Viking battles, we also have our own living history exhibit. This constitutes a military encampment for a 
        Viking unit on campaign, made up of portable tents and sea chests. This forms the backdrop to our public events, as well as providing our home for the weekend. 
    </p>
    <p>Here, we sample the Viking way, gathered around the central cooking fire to meet the public and educate about the history of 
        the Viking Age. In the encampment the public can meet Viking warriors, try on their armour and helmets, hold a shield and sword and maybe, 
        if they are unlucky, be clamped in slave-chains. Around them craftsmen are at work, warriors are repairing and maintaining their weapons, 
        a harpist plays and over the fire, our evening meal cooks. 
    </p>
    <p>You can see us in action at our Facebook page - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Friends-of-Y-Ddraig-151543158238807">Friends of Y Ddraig</a>
