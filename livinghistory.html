    <h1>Living History</h1>
    <p>As well as the fighting in Viking battles, we also have our own living history exhibit, a military encampment for a 
        Viking unit on campaign, of portable tents and sea chests. This forms the backdrop to our public events, as well as providing our weekend home. 
    </p>
    <p>Here we live the Viking way for a few days, gathered around the central cooking fire and meet the public to educate about the history of 
        the Viking Age (a subject we obviously find fascinating). In the encampment the public can meet Viking warriors, try on their 
        armour and helmets, hold a shield and sword or maybe, if they are unlucky, be clamped in slave-chains, whilst around them 
        craftsmen work, warriors repair and maintain weapons, a harpist plays and, over the fire, our evening meal cooks. 
    </p>
    <p>You can see us (and others) in action at our Facebook page - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Friends-of-Y-Ddraig-151543158238807">Friends of Y Ddraig</a>
